      Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) facilitates quicker and more straightforward execution.
      OOP offers a distinct framework for organizing programs.
      OOP aids in maintaining C# code's adherence to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, streamlining maintenance, modification, and debugging processes.
      OOP enables the development of fully reusable applications with reduced code and shorter development durations.     
        
      Reusable, clean and well-structured code = OOP.
