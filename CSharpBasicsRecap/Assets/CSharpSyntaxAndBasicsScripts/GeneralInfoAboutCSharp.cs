           C# Syntax in Unity; 
           
           The method named Start() works when the game has started. You can declare your variables or doing your actions
           in there once when started the game. It will work for one time only.
     
           The method named Update() works once per frame. Declaring variable in that method is not a good way. You can 
           check for some events in this method such as the player's input.

           Every C# statement ends with a semicolon. Ex: int a = 10; - You can think this as dot at the end of sentence.
